## Latch WF for Over-Representation Analysis (ORA)

### **Summary**
ORA is a widely used approach to determine whether known biological functions or processes are over-represented (= enriched) in an experimentally-derived gene list, e.g. a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

### **Input**
A .csv file with a column containing gene names.

### **Output**
An HTML report with pathway and gene ontology enrichment results.  In addition,  a folder with publication-ready plots.
